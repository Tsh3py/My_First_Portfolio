    <title>My Cool First Webpage</title> </head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Awesome Portfolio!</h1>
    <p>This is my first paragraph. I'm excited to be learning HTML and building my skills as a front-end developer with ALX.</p>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This page demonstrates some basic HTML elements I've learned, including paragraphs, different heading levels, and how to embed images.</p>
    <p>It's a small step, but every line of code brings me closer to my goal of creating amazing web experiences.</p>

    <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
    <p>I've already completed JavaScript fundamentals and now I'm diving into HTML. It's challenging but incredibly rewarding to see my progress.</p>
